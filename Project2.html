	<h1> what you can do about your future ?! </h1>
<pre>
<p><i> You don’t need to burn the dock to push off your boat. 
You don’t need to dis’ how you’ve done things in order to do 
things differently.
There’s no need to criticize the past to validate the future.
But we do.
We look at how we over worked it, or how we missed the mark
, or all the reasons it,
they, you, me, we fell short. We start to shrink the 
value of the past so that
we can justify taking new aim, or giving notice, or taking the leap that will move
us in a new direction. We give ourselves and others logical
— and often deprecating — reasons that it’s time for
 a change.
We take a perfectly good essay of our life-learning and 
accomplishments, 
and we red pen it with margin notes of all that could have
 been done differently 
so that we can damn well do it differently next time.
	
Not only does dissing how you got to where you are dishonor your past 
and make for some negative juju, it weighs on your transformational process.
How you regard your past influences how your future unfolds. 
		
You did what you needed to do at the time with what you had to work with.
Thankfully, praise be, alleluia! Now let’s move on to the part when you have a break 
through and wake up knowing more. It’s not about knowing better, it’s about knowing more.</i>
